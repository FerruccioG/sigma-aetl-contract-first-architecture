```json
{
  "shipment_id": "",
  "weight_kg": -5,
  "destination": "Dublin"
}
```

Why this is a good invalid example (for your own sanity later)

This payload fails multiple contract rules at once, which is ideal for demonstrations:

❌ shipment_id is an empty string (violates min length)

❌ weight_kg is negative (violates numeric constraint)

❌ priority is missing (required field)

This guarantees:

Validator returns FAILED

Workflow takes the FALSE branch

Record is persisted into failed_shipments

Optional AI diagnostics can activate

📌 Do not “fix” this payload — it is intentionally broken and should stay that way.
